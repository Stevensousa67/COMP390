The purpose of this application is to filter a large data set from NASA. The target dataset is a collection of 45,716
data entries. Each entry has information about a single meteorite landing on Earth. During runtime, the user
will select if the data should be filtered by mass - and consequently set the upper and lower bounds of the mass filter
 - or by year the meteorite fell onto Earth.
