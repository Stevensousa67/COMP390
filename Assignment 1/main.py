The purpose of this application is to filter a large data set. The target dataset is a collection of 45,716
data entries. Each entry has information about a single meteorite landing on Earth. The filter will display
meteorites that weigh more than 2,900,000 grams (do not include meteorites that weigh
2,900,000 grams or less) and meteorites that fell within the last ten years (do not include meteorites that fell
before 2013. Include meteorites that fell in 2013 and after.).
